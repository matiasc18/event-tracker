The seminar will feature speaker Sean Mondesire, an assistant research professor at the UCF Institute for Simulation and Training.\u0026nbsp\u003B\u003C/p\u003E\u000A\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbstract\u003C/strong\u003E: Online e\u002Dlearning platforms and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) provide convenient and controlled environments for learning, boosting accessibility and education standardization in and out of the classroom. For instance, many online ITSs are accessible to students 24/7 on desktops and mobile devices and provide automated feedback, maximizing learning robustness and schedule flexibility to students. A growing design consideration of ITSs is its customization to the student. Modern systems tailor the student experience through personalized content, assessments, remediation, and acceleration plans. Common challenges in these systems are that they collect minimal data and customization is slow, reactionary, and generalized. This talk discusses work that improves ITS effectiveness through real\u002Dtime student performance modeling and machine learning to navigate these challenges. Specifically, the work explores personalized algorithmic solutions that predict when students need assistance and builds a digital student model framework for existing ITSs and e\u002Dlearning platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\u000A\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBiography\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026nbsp\u003B\u003C/strong\u003ESean Mondesire, Ph.D. is an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Central Florida\u0027s (UCF) Institute for Simulation and Training. He holds a doctorate in Computer Science from UCF where he concentrated on transfer learning and decision\u002Dmaking of autonomous, multi\u002Dagent systems. He is currently the director of the Human\u002Dcentered Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (HAIL) and co\u002Ddirector of the UCF\u0026rsquo\u003Bs Advanced Research Computing Center. Previously, Dr. Mondesire held a post\u002Ddoctoral research position at the United States Army Research Laboratory Human Research and Engineering Directorate and served as Assistant Professor and Program Director of Computer Science, Big Data Analytics, and Cybersecurity Analytics at St. Thomas University.
